> **_trai´chu,** _n_. A simple, semantic start page built with HTML, CSS, and a mouse-sized bit of JavaScript.
 
**_traichu's** markup is [valid](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ftressley.github.io%2F_traichu%2Findex.html) and aims to adhere to HTML semantics. [Traditional Japanese](https://www.nipponcolors.com), [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) compliant colors make up the color palette. The monospace font is ol' [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) loaded via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). Icons are [inline SVGs](https://css-tricks.com/pretty-good-svg-icon-system/), [DuckDuckGo's API](https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/duckduckgo.com.ico) delivers the favicons, and [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org) provides the weather forecast and icons. Vanilla JavaScript and CSS handle all interactivity.

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) is the default search engine because privacy is important 'round here.
